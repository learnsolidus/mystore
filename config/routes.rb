  # This line mounts Solidus's routes at the root of your application.
  #
  # Unless you manually picked only a subset of Solidus components, this will mount routes for:
  #   - solidus_backend
  #   - solidus_api
  # This means, any requests to URLs such as /admin/products, will go to Spree::Admin::ProductsController.
  #
  # If you are using the Starter Frontend as your frontend, be aware that all the storefront routes are defined
  # separately in this file and are not part of the Solidus::Core::Engine engine.
  #
  # If you would like to change where this engine is mounted, simply change the :at option to something different.
  # We ask that you don't use the :as option here, as Solidus relies on it being the default of "spree"
